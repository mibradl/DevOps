# Name: Build Tools And DevOps

# Description: 

Software Development and Software Engineering

Why should you know these Build Tools?

When the Developers are writing the code

    They use the tools to run applications

    Execute tests

    Configure Dependencies 

    Developers install dependencies locally and run the app, but don't build it locally.



DevOps Engineers are responsible

    Helping developers to build the application

    The Engineer will know where and how it will run

    Build Docker Image => Push to Repo => Run on Server - Jenkins manages this

    Need to configure the build automation tool / CI/CD Pipeline

        install dependencies

        run tests

        build/bundle app

        push to repo

        Don't run the app locally



        You need to execute tests on the build servers

            npm/yarn test

            gradle/mvn test

        Build and package into Docker Image

            peform docker build
