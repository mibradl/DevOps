This module we looked how to install the package manager.

# Name: Install Build Tools

# Description: 

Tools we need to install

We use build tools to buils a Java application

    1. Install Java
    2. Install Maven
    3. Install Gradle, an alternative Java tool

These are build tools for building java applications


Next we will need to build a JavaScript application

    1. NPM
    2. Nodejs

Also, good to have a nice code editor to work with:

    1. Intellije - makes it java friendly
    2. Visual Studio Code

Will use step by step guides, based on operating system

The DevOps Engineer will need to be comfortable installing tools on different OS systems often.
