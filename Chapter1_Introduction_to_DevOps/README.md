Introduction to DevOps

Overview and Concepts explained

    Software Development and the roles surrounding it

    Different roles with different job descriptions

        Software Development Lifecycle - consisting of developers, sysadmins, etc

            Plan

            Implement

            Test

            Deploy

            Maintain

        Good overview of own department

            Overall big picture

        Roles and responsibilities of DevOps Engineer

            How do roles fit together to form the cycle?

        
    Facebook

    To build such an application requires all different IT roles

    Programming

        Software is programmed by developers

        In different programming languages, e.g. Java, Python, JavaScript

        Small App - one team per app or per feature

        FB Messenger                FB Pixel

        FB Shops                    FB Conversions API

        These teams create new functionality

        They also fix bugs if they arise


    Software Testing

        Test the new features

        Test the old code/functionality

        Testing is done by developers and dedicated testers

            Imagine how complex it is to test and develop for a company the size of FB

        To minimize complexity we use automated testing


    Release of Software

        Requires you Build the application

        Run it on Servers

        Upgrade existing software


    Operations

        Run software in production




    Traditional: Development versus Operations


                            Release

        Development                             Operations

                                                No downtime

                                                Handle huge traffic

        programming languages                   OS, mostly Linux

        test frameworks                         command-line

        databases                               scripting

        version control                         monitoring tools



    Different responsibilities

    Different technical knowledge

    Different tools




    Communication is important since responsibilities differ

    In reality silos between these two groups

    Developers develop the app

        Testers test

        The release is handed over to the Ops team

        Dev team documents instructions how to deploy

    Operations

        Deployment requires configurations

            Env vars

            Folders on server

            OP team follow Dev instructions

        Environment needs to be prepared, 
        
            Many times instructions are not clear 
            
            Components are missing, etc.

            Release takes long


    How to solve these issues?


        DevOps Culture

        DevOps was just a way of working between Development and Operations

        Common language to communicate

        Became its own role and job

            many new concepts and tools

            DevOps Engineer


        DevOps tasks and responsibilities

        Needs some know-how from DEV and OPS team

        Additionally, DevOps has a set of unique, specific skills and know how

        Building continuous integration and continuous delivery (commit, test, build, push, deploy)  - CI/CD Pipeline


    Waterfall vs. Agile

        Influences speed and process of software development

        The way an organization is developing applications


        Traditional WATERFALL

            Requirements

                Plan everything beforehand

                Development would be handled by developers one feature at a time

                The App would be handed over to Testing team

                Passed to Operations and a huge implementation would be prepared

            Ineffective process

            Over time new requirements would arise

            Many places of failure and miscommunication

            Feedback was often slow



        Agile was adopted

            Benefits of Agile

                Speed of development, testing and deployment cycles

                    Continuous Integrations

                    Continuous Delivery

                Each feature gets tested, deployed

                Immediate feedback

                Fast development and deployment process

                Scrum and kanban - specific implementations


            Devops process enhances the human element or manual process with automation tools
