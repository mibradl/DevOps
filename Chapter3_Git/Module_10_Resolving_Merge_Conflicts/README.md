This module we discuss resolving merge conflicts.

# Name: Resolving Merge Conflicts

# Description: 

Two or more developers update the same line of code and begin pushing code to remote repo. This of course will cause merge conflicts.

Before I can make any changes I first have to fetch that change.

And although I pull the change from the remote repo with rebase (git pull -r), I receive a merge conflict message. The issue is Git doesn't know which of the two changes you want to take.

You must tell Git which change to take.
