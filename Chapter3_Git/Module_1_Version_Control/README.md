# Chapter2
This module we learned the basic concepts Version Control

# Name: Version Control

# Description: 

What is Version Control?

Developers working on the same code need a way to share the code
Code is hosted centrally on the internet
Every developer has an entire copy of the code locally
Code is fetched from repo and pushed to code repo
Git knows how to merge changes automatically
Merge Conflicts - e.g. when same line has changed - Git can't fix it alone ...must be solved manually
Best Practice: push and pull often from the remote repo.
This is called "Continuous Integration" - Integrate your code changes frequently

Breaking changes don't affect you until you pull the new code
Version Control keeps a history of changes
Every code change and file is tracked
You can revert commits
Each change is labelled with commit message
