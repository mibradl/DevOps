This module we discussed using Git for DevOps.

# Name: Git for DevOps

# Description: 

We reviewed how to use Git for Development.

For what use cases would you use Git for DevOps?

1. When working with Infrastructure as Code

    Many Kubernetes Configuration Files - Deployment to Kubernetes
    Files for creating volumes
    For creating DBs
    Helm charts

2. Use Terraform and Ansible Configuration Files

3. Bash and Python Scripts

Each of these will be files tracked over time

Securely stored in one place

Files should be shareable for DevOps team

This would require Git repository for this.



When working with CI/CD platform and Build Automation tool

1. Checkout code, test and build application, etc.

2. Need integration between the build automation tool and application git repository

3. You need to setup integration between build automation tool and git repository
    git & Jenkins
    git & Concourse

    Getting commit hash if specific hash
    Checking if changes happen in frontend or backend code
