# Chapter3
This module we discuss the use of the merge request.

# Name: Merge Request

# Description: 

The best practice before merging is for other developers to review code changes before merging.

Code must be stable and ready for production.

Use cases: big feature, junior developer or expertise in different area

Great chance to learn and grow from each other

Pull Requests - GitHub is called Pull Request / GitLab is called Merge Request

On the remote git repo

    Code owner makes request

    Assignee can approve or decline the request, and leave comments

    Once appropriate changes are made the merge can be approved, which merges the feature/bugfix feature to the master branch



Allows code to be reviewed from the feature/bugfix branch before merging into master branch.

Upon creating the request the merge/pull request can be assigned to another team member for approval or review.
